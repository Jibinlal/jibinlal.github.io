This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis and preparation of the Diabetes 130-Hospitals Dataset using Python. The dataset, which includes ten years of clinical data from 130 hospitals, provides a rich source of information on patient demographics, diagnoses, lab results, and medications. The primary goal of this project was to perform exploratory data analysis, followed by meticulous data cleaning and standardization. The resulting dataset is now well-prepared for the application of machine learning models, paving the way for future predictive analytics in diabetes care.
