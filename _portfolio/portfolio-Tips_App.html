Introducing the ‘Simplifying Tips’ app, designed specifically for Cafe Landwer. For years, the cafe has relied on manual calculations for tracking employee tips, which were error-prone and made it difficult to accurately calculate earnings for pay periods. To address these issues, I created a simple, easy-to-use web app that offers a reliable, error-free way to calculate and summarize tips earned by employees. With the Tips app, Cafe Landwer can ensure accurate paystubs and say goodbye to manual calculations, while welcoming a more efficient and accurate way of managing employee tips.
