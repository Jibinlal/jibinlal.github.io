This project leverages SAS to analyze nearly a decade of arthritis data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). By examining annual health indicator estimates across household income quintiles and education levels, the study uncovers critical disparities and trends in arthritis prevalence at the sub-provincial level. These insights provide valuable guidance for healthcare policymakers to design equitable and data-driven interventions.
